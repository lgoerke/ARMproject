Project for the course 'Advanced Research Methods'.

CollaborationAssessment on Google Docs so that format problems are avoided https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p_dcNYnDBCOZLT1lT0Tw7iKHCBbx0M3_QsGcAIOORMU/edit?usp=sharing

Steps to run NN:
* go to https://github.com/heuritech/convnets-keras
* follow steps to install h5py, Theano, Keras and flickrapi
* download VGG16 weights following provided link
* run script to get Flickrimages (folders will be created by script)
* run classification
* NB: downloaded images and weights will be ignored by git to avoid too large files (cf gitignore)
